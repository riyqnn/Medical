# 🌐 Medly: The Future of Secure Healthcare Records in Indonesia

---

## 🩺 Overview :

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are digital systems that replace traditional paper charts by storing patients’ medical histories, diagnoses, medications, and treatments. In Indonesia, however, these systems often operate in isolated and centralized silos, making it difficult for healthcare providers to access comprehensive patient data across multiple hospitals. This fragmentation slows down care, increases the risk of errors, and compromises accuracy—ultimately limiting the quality of healthcare that patients receive.

Medly offers a breakthrough by leveraging the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain to decentralize EMR storage. Each registered hospital connects directly to tamper-proof patient records, creating a secure and interoperable ecosystem where medical data can be safely shared and verified. With this approach, doctors gain instant access to complete patient histories, enabling better decision-making and higher-quality care, while patients maintain transparency and full ownership of their data. By combining blockchain technology with patient-centered care, Medly ensures improved healthcare outcomes while remaining aligned with local health regulations.
