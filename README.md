🌐 Medly: The Future of Secure Healthcare Records in Indonesia

🩺 Overview :
Electronic Medical Records (EMR) are digital systems that replace traditional paper charts by storing patients’ medical histories, diagnoses, medications, and treatments. However, in Indonesia, these systems often exist in isolated, centralized silos, making it difficult for healthcare providers to access comprehensive patient data across multiple hospitals—slowing down care and compromising accuracy. Medly offers a breakthrough by leveraging the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain to decentralize EMR storage. Each registered hospital links directly to tamper-proof patient records, creating a secure and interoperable ecosystem where medical data can be safely shared and verified. Doctors gain instant access to complete patient histories, improving decision-making and care quality, while patients enjoy transparency and full ownership of their data. By bridging technology with patient-centered care, Medly ensures improved healthcare outcomes while aligning with local health regulations.
