# 🌐 Medly: The Future of Secure Healthcare Records

---

## 🩺 Overview :

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) have revolutionized healthcare by replacing traditional paper-based systems with digital records. However, many EMR solutions today remain **fragmented, centralized, and lack interoperability**, making it difficult for healthcare providers to securely access complete patient data across different hospitals or regions.  

This leads to:  
- Delayed care coordination  
- Higher risk of errors due to incomplete information  
- Limited patient control over sensitive medical data  
- Privacy and security concerns  

**Medly** solves this by leveraging **Internet Computer (ICP)** blockchain to create a **decentralized, secure, and interoperable EMR ecosystem** where:  
- **Hospitals** can register, onboard doctors, and manage records seamlessly.  
- **Doctors** gain instant, permissioned access to complete patient histories.  
- **Patients** maintain transparency and ownership over their healthcare data.  

By combining **blockchain technology** with **patient-centered care**, Medly ensures improved healthcare outcomes, privacy, and regulatory compliance on a **global scale**.

## 🚀 Problem Statement  

- **Centralization:** Single points of failure, prone to data breaches.  
- **Lack of Interoperability:** EMR systems operate in silos.  
- **Limited Patient Control:** Patients lack visibility over who accesses their data.  
- **Security Concerns:** Medical data is highly sensitive yet often poorly protected.

## 💡 Solution Architecture  

**Key Workflow:**  
1. Hospital registers → Access to **Hospital Dashboard**  
2. Hospital mints doctors → **Automatic Doctor Account Creation**  
3. Doctor logs in → Access to **Doctor Dashboard**  
4. Doctor uploads encrypted medical records → Stored on **IPFS** with hashes on **ICP blockchain**
